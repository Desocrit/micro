# micro

The buggy-but-functional 1.0 build of 'micro', a strategy game I developed at age 15.
To run, download the .swf file and open it via any browser with Flash installed.
Do not try to run the .swf file without a browser, as it may not work if used any other way.

How to Play

Firstly, you probably want to mute the game. The music stopped seeming appropriate several years ago. Then, select Campaign, and press the icon to begin the tutorial. You’ll want to at least read the unit guide before starting each level – the complexity ramps up fast, and the game assumes you already know exactly what each of the units does. Also, learn to use the keyboard commands. You’ll be quick enough to get past level 3 without them.
